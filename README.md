Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using linear regression. The dataset used contains information about different houses, including their size, number of bedrooms, age, and other relevant factors. By training a linear regression model on this data, we can estimate the price of a house given its features.
Files
data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset.
linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for training the linear regression model and making predictions.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.
Results
The trained model achieves [accuracy/MSE/R-squared/etc.] on the test set, indicating [performance evaluation]. Example predictions are shown in the notebook, demonstrating how the model estimates housing prices based on input features.

Future Improvements
Include more features or explore different types of regression models for potentially better performance.
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model further.
Consider additional data sources or external factors that may influence housing prices.
